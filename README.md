# Senior-Capstone-Neural-Network-Training-
Collection of files I used for my senior year capstone project, where we created a robot utilizing a convolutional neural net to designate and pick up trash and recyclables.

Goals of the Python Files:

1. Using CUDA and Python, train a YOLO object detection algorithm to recognize and articulate where an object is within a frame of video input.
2. Classify objects as the correct type of waste (7 classes: trash, plastic, paper, cardboard, metal, glass, and batteries.
3. Monitor computer resources and processes that could potentially throttle components such as the CPU or overload others such as the RAM.
4. Format models to be usable, executable, and scalable on other systems (such as on our Jetson Orin Nano).

Sources such as the VIA Image Annotator were used for manual identification of objects within photo frames, whose weights were put into csv files and converted to usable formats for training and fine tuning.
